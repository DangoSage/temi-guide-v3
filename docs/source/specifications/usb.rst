Hardware
========
The temi Robot v3 CE is equipped with a USB Host port (5V/900mA, 4.5W).


USB Host Ports
==============
USB host ports are the standard ports found on desktop computers and laptops. They can be used to attach USB peripherals, like mouse, keyboard, microphone, webcam, etc. 

temi's USB Host port is meant to be used by an Android developer that wants to create an application that, for example, uses a USB thermal camera. It is also compatible with some 4G/LTE dongles aimed specifically at the Chinese market, which allows temi to operate on a mobile connection instead of Wi-Fi.


FAQ
===
`Q: Can this port be used to access Android like wired ADB?`

  No. USB host ports cannot be used for wired ADB.

`Q: Is it possible to set permissions on this USB port?`

  No, this is not possible.

`Q: Can I use a USB camera and/or microphone with temi's video calling app?`

  Yes, it is possible to use a USB camera but not a microphone with temi's video calling app. In the case of a webcam with built-in microphone, double tapping the video call screen on either temi app or temi center will cause the streamed video to alternate between the tablet's camera and the webcam. However, all audio will still be streamed from the tablet's built-in microphone.
